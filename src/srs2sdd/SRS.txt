Healthcare System - Software Requirements Specification

1. Introduction
In this age, the focus is on digitalizing user journeys to save money and time and bring convenience to consumers. Consumer interactions which couldn't be imagined to be digitalized in the past have been made possible through technology. One such digitalization, which has been popular with consumers, is retail grocery shopping. Such advancements have made life easy for everyone, especially for people with physical conditions due to diseases or age. Yet, it has been observed that the digitalization of patients needing healthcare is limited in terms of outreach and services.
Hence, this app has been designed to improve the reach of small to medium size healthcare providers to patients. Often, owing to high expenses such healthcare providers shy away from establishing a digital journey for their clients. Hence, they have a limited customer base and a high churn ratio. This app, hosted on a multi-tenant cloud environment, will help these healthcare providers improve their market share through outreach and customer satisfaction.
This app has simple yet high user experience journeys designed for patients. With minimal clicks and assistance, patients can navigate through this app with least hindrance. They can manage their health consultations from past and present at one site with features such as return visit scheduling, rescheduling, digital prescriptions and teleconsultations.
Initially, this app would provide out-patient services such as appointment booking and management. However, the framework will allow faster addition of newer services and more stakeholder journeys.
Each healthcare provider would have their own app with their data separate from other providers in a multi-tenant SAAS environment.
The plan is to cover 80% of the SME in the healthcare provider market of any metropolitan city.

2. Purpose
The primary purpose of this application is to extend the reach of small to medium-sized healthcare providers to a broader patient base by offering a cost-effective digital solution. This aims to enhance patient convenience through features like online appointment management, digital prescriptions, and teleconsultations, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and market share for healthcare providers. The application will initially focus on outpatient services, with a scalable framework to incorporate additional services and stakeholders in the future, and will also include AI-driven diagnosis.

3. Scope
This project encompasses the development of a multi-tenant SaaS application designed to facilitate patient registration, medical profile creation, appointment booking (both in-person and virtual), and online payment processing. Healthcare providers will be able to manage service listings, onboard and manage practitioners, manage appointments, upload prescriptions, and generate reports. Doctors can view appointments, update medical histories, and create prescriptions. Patient data will be fetched, inserted, and updated within the client's EHR system without being stored within the application's cloud platform, ensuring data privacy and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR). Patients will have access to an AI-driven symptom checker to assist in preliminary diagnosis. The application focuses on outpatient services and excludes certain integrations and functionalities as detailed in the "Out of Scope" section.


4. In Scope
Initially, this app will let consumers register and create their medical profile. They can then book in-patient or virtual appointments and pay for it online through multiple channels. They can upload their past medical history, download prescriptions, book follow-up visits to a doctor amongst features described in this document.
Healthcare providers can manage their services list, onboard healthcare practitioners, remove practitioners, manage appointments, and upload prescriptions and medical history for patients. They will have the option to generate management reports of their financial, operational or customer data.
Doctors can view their appointments, update patient medical history, change appointment status, create patient prescription and generate a printout of the prescription for the patient.
The app will be hosted on a multi-tenant SAAS platform, where the data of each service provider will be kept secure and distinct from other providers. Patient medical records EHR will be maintained in the client facility. This app will fetch, insert and update EHR data but, would not store the data in the app's multi-tenant cloud platform.
All authentication processes would comply with relevant data protection laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) to ensure patient data remains secure and private
The process of registration of a patient is fully automated. The registration of a health care staff will be created by a system admin. Login for a healthcare professional or doctor would be created by a health care staff while onboarding individual doctors.
Only a patient can create an appointment, but is not allowed to delete an appointment. They can reschedule an appointment before 24hrs. Doctors can modify appointments but cannot delete it. Appointments can only be deleted by healthcare staff.
Patients can only view prescriptions, whereas doctors and healthcare staffs can create and modify it.
Management reports can be generated by healthcare staffs only.
Patients with be given an option of an AI driven symptom checker. This chat bot will analyse patient's symptoms and, suggest possible causes and the type of doctor to consult.


5. Out of Scope
The following functionalities and integrations are explicitly excluded from the scope of this application:
•	Third-party integrations: Integration with external third-party services, including but not limited to ambulance operators, pharmacies, medical tourism agencies, external billing systems, and specialized diagnostic equipment interfaces, are not included in the initial release.
